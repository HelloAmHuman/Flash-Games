This is a coolection of flash files which ill use in my site at https://sites.google.com/view/ali-and-zane-are-cool/home

Ill use the script:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ruffle-rs/ruffle"></script>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<embed height="620" pluginspage=" http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" src="SWF FILE NAME HERE e.g. https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/HelloAmHuman/flash-games@main/cool.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="1080"></embed></div>

to embed them.

Ill use the free tool at https://www.jsdelivr.com/github to put them in the script with CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Thats about it!
